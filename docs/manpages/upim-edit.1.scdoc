# NAME

upim-edit - manage uPIM Notes


# SYNOPSIS

*upim-edit* [_OPTION_...] _FILE_

# DESCRIPTION

uPIM is a collection of libraries and applications to form the building blocks
for a personal information management system.

upim-edit provides note management functions, such as adding or removing tags
and attributes. It can also wrap your system text editor for convenient editing
of files within collections, and will validate the note's header upon exit.

# NOTES

uPIM notes are UTF-8 encoded files that contain a header, a blank line, then
optionally a textual document. The header contains zero or more tags and
attributes.

A tag is a string beginning with '@', such as "@apple" or "@some-tag". Tags may
contain any sequence of UTF-8 character codes except space (' '). Multiple tags
may exist on a line.

Attributes are key-value pairs on a single line, separated by a colon (':') and
enclosed in square brackets ('[' and ']'); such as "[key: value]". An
attribute's key cannot contain a colon, and neither the key nor value may
contain a square bracket; all other sequences of UTF-8 code points are allowed.
Only one attribute is allowed on a single line, and no tags may share a line
with an attribute.

A note with an empty header simply begins with a blank line.

This format can easily support many types of information:

- Diary/journal entries
- Travel plans/iteneraries
- Recipes
- Lists (books to read, TODO lists, etc.)
- Many other types of structured or semi-structured data

## Note Template

A note template is a note saved to the templates folder specified by the global
uPIM configuration, with a ".template" extension. When creating a note in a
collection, the new note will be created from the template for that collection.

# CONFIGURATION

upim-edit uses the global uPIM configuration to find collections and load note
templates for the relevant collection.

In addition, upim-edit searches for the following configuration files, in order:

. /etc/upim/upim-edit.conf
. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/upim/upim.conf if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is defined; otherwise
  $HOME/.config/upim/upim.conf
. (current working directory)/.upim.conf

A upim-edit configuration file must exist, though it may be empty if $EDITOR is
set. The upim-edit.conf file may define new collections, override global
collections, and override the global template folder. See *upim.conf*(5) for
more information.

# ENVIRONMENT

upim-edit will launch the executable named by $EDITOR, if set.

# EXIT STATUS

Returns 0 on success, 1 on failure.

# EXAMPLES

## Example Note Template

A note template is a partial (and possibly-invalid) note that functions as a
form for new notes within a collection. A template for the Contacts collection
may look something like this:

```
@
[Name: ]
[Spouse: ]
[Children: ]
[Work phone: ]
[Cell phone: ]
[Address: ]

@Employer
[Name: ]
```

When creating a new note in the Contacts group, the editor will be pre-filled
with the contents of the template.

```
$ upim-edit -C Contacts Favorite-Person.contact
```

## Example Note

Given the following recipe as a markdown document in the "Recipes" collection,
and named "favorite-food.md":

```
@low-fat
[Name: My Favorite Food]
[Author: Some Person]
[Prep time: 5 minutes, maybe a few days]

# My Favorite Food

This is a great meal to serve for guests.

## Ingredients

* Water
* Salt

## Instructions

Mix the water and salt together. Let dry.
```

Add a "@low-carb" tag:

```
$ upim-edit -C Recipes --add-tag @low-carb favorite-food.md
```

Use pandoc to convert the recipe to html:

```
$ upim-edit -C Recipes --document favorite-food.md \\
	| pandoc -s -t html -o favorite-food.html
```

Edit the recipe using $EDITOR:

```
$ upim-edit -C Recipes favorite-food.md
```
